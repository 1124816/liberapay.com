    <p>If you have found a security issue, and it's not <a href="https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ASelf-defense">already known</a>, then please send a report to <a onclick="$(this).html('admin&amp;#64;liberapay.com')">[click to see email address]</a>.</p>

    <p>We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly resolve any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you nor ask law enforcement to investigate you providing you comply with the following guideline:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Exclusions</h3>

    <p>The following <b>test types</b> are excluded from the scope:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating).</li>

        <li>Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing).</li>

        <li>Reports that state that software is out of date or vulnerable without a proof of concept.</li>

        <li>Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage. Be concrete.</li>

        <li>Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they are an issue.</li>

        <li>Issues in third-party services should be reported to the respective team.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The following <b>issue types</b> are excluded from scope:</p>
    
    <td>Low severity issues that can be detected with tools such as <a href="https://www.hardenize.com/">Hardenize</a> and <a href="https://securityheaders.io/">Security Headers</a>.</td>
    <td>We run regular scans with these services and try to improve our score gradually.</td>

       <td>Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) with minimal security implications (Logout CSRF, etc.).</td>
       <td>In order for CSRF to be a valid issue it must affect some important action such as deleting oneâ€™s account.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td>Missing cookie flags on non-security-sensitive cookies.</td>
       <td>These type of issues do not present a major risk and are usually picked up by scanners.</td>

    <tr>
       <td>Stack traces that disclose information.</td>
       <td>Most of our projects are open-source therefore this information is usually public knowledge. <strong>That said, if you discover a stack trace that discloses information which is not located in our GitHub repositories, please do submit a report.</strong></td>

       <td>Missing <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header (Clickjacking)</td>
       <td>The lack of <code>X-Frame-Options</code> does not always indicate that a security vulnerability is present.
